## Part A - General

#### Rule 1 - Application

    (a) These Rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels.

    (b) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of special rules made by an appropriate authority for roadsteads, harbours, rivers, lakes or inland waterways connected with the high seas and navigable by seagoing vessels. Such special rules shall conform as closely as possible to these Rules.

    (c) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Government of any State with respect to additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape or signal authorized elsewhere under these Rules.

    (d) Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organization for the purpose of these Rules.

    (e) Whenever the Government concerned shall have determined that a vessel of special construction or purpose cannot comply fully with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, such vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, as her Government shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect of that vessel.
  
#### Rule 2 - Responsibility

    (a) Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these Rules or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.

    (b) In construing and complying with these Rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the vessels involved, which may make a departure from these Rules necessary to avoid immediate danger.

#### Rule 3 - General definitions

For the purpose of these Rules, except where the context otherwise requires:

    (a) The word “vessel” includes every description of water craft, including non-displacement craft, WIG craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.

    (b) The term “power-driven vessel” means any vessel propelled by machinery.

    (c) The term “sailing vessel” means any vessel under sail provided that propelling machinery, if fitted, is not being used.

    (d) The term “vessel engaged in fishing” means any vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls or other fishing apparatus which restrict manoeuvrability, but does not include a vessel fishing with trolling lines or other fishing apparatus which do not restrict manoeuvrability.

    (e) The word “seaplane” includes any aircraft designed to manoeuvre on the water.

    (f) The term “vessel not under command” means a vessel which through some exceptional circumstance is unable to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel.

    (g) The term “vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre” means a vessel which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel. The term “vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre” shall include but not be limited to:

        (i) a vessel engaged in laying, servicing or picking up a navigation mark, submarine cable or pipeline;
        (ii) a vessel engaged in dredging, surveying or underwater operations;
        (iii) a vessel engaged in replenishment or transferring persons, provisions or cargo while underway;
        (iv) a vessel engaged in the launching or recovery of aircraft;
        (v) a vessel engaged in mine clearance operations;
        (vi) a vessel engaged in a towing operation such as severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow in their ability to deviate from their course.

    (h) The term “vessel constrained by her draught” means a power-driven vessel which, because of her draught in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water, is severely restricted in her ability to deviate from the course she is following.

    (i) The word “underway” means that a vessel is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.

    (j) The words “length” and “breadth” of a vessel mean her length overall and greatest breadth.

    (k) Vessels shall be deemed to be in sight of one another only when one can be observed visually from the other.

    (l) The term “restricted visibility” means any condition in which visibility is restricted by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms or any other similar causes.

    (m) The term “Wing-In-Ground (WIG) craft” means a multimodal craft which, in its main operational mode, flies in close proximity to the surface by utilizing surface-effect action.

## Part B - Steering and sailing rule

### Section I - Conduct of Vessels in any Condition of Visibility

#### Rule 4 - Application

Rules in this section apply in any condition of visibility.

#### Rule 5 - Look-out

Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.

#### Rule 6 - Safe speed

Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.

In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:

    (a) By all vessels:

        (i) the state of visibility;
        (ii) the traffic density including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels;
        (iii) the manoeuvrability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;
        (iv) at night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights;
        (v) the state of wind, sea and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;
        (vi) the draught in relation to the available depth of water.

    (b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:

        (i) the characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment;
        (ii) any constraints imposed by the radar range scale in use;
        (iii) the effect on radar detection of the sea state, weather and other sources of interference;
        (iv) the possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by radar at an adequate range;
        (v) the number, location and movement of vessels detected by radar;
        (vi) the more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.

#### Rule 7 - Risk of collision

    (a) Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists. If there is any doubt such risk shall be deemed to exist.

    (b) Proper use shall be made of radar equipment if fitted and operational, including long-range scanning to obtain early warning of risk of collision and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects.

    (c) Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information, especially scanty radar information.

    (d) In determining if risk of collision exists the following considerations shall be among those taken into account:

        (i) such risk shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not appreciably change;
        (ii) such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is evident, particularly when approaching a very large vessel or a tow or when approaching a vessel at close range.
        
#### Rule 8 - Action to avoid collision

    (a) Any action to avoid collision shall be taken in accordance with the Rules of this Part and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.

    (b) Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course and/or speed should be avoided.

    (c) If there is sufficient sea-room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.

    (d) Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.

    (e) If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping or reversing her means of propulsion.

    (f)
        (i) A vessel which, by any of these Rules, is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case, take early action to allow sufficient sea-room for the safe passage of the other vessel.
        (ii) A vessel required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel is not relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the Rules of this part.
        (iii) A vessel the passage of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the Rules of this part when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.

#### Rule 9 - Narrow channels

    (a) A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or fairway which lies on her starboard side as is safe and practicable.

    (b) A vessel of less than 20 metres in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.

    (c) A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.

    (d) A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway. The latter vessel may use the sound signal prescribed in Rule 34(d) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel.

    (e)
        (i) In a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking can take place only if the vessel to be overtaken has to take action to permit safe passing, the vessel intending to overtake shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c)(i). The vessel to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(c)(ii) and take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt she may sound the signals prescribed in Rule 34(d).
        (ii) This Rule does not relieve the overtaking vessel of her obligation under Rule 13.

    (f) A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate signal prescribed in Rule 34(e).

    (g) Any vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.

#### Rule 10 - Traffic separation schemes

    (a) This Rule applies to traffic separation schemes adopted by the Organization and does not relieve any vessel of her obligation under any other rule.

    (b) A vessel using a traffic separation scheme shall:

        (i) proceed in the appropriate traffic lane in the general direction of traffic flow for that lane;
        (ii) so far as practicable keep clear of a traffic separation line or separation zone;
        (iii) normally join or leave a traffic lane at the termination of the lane, but when joining or leaving from either side shall do so at as small an angle to the general direction of traffic flow as practicable.

    (c) A vessel shall, so far as practicable, avoid crossing traffic lanes but if obliged to do so shall cross on a heading as nearly as practicable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow.

    (d)

        (i) A vessel shall not use an inshore traffic zone when she can safely use the appropriate traffic lane within the adjacent traffic separation scheme. However, vessels of less than 20 metres in length, sailing vessels and vessels engaged in fishing may use the inshore traffic zone.
        (ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (d)(i), a vessel may use an inshore traffic zone when en route to or from a port, offshore installation or structure, pilot station or any other place situated within the inshore traffic zone, or to avoid immediate danger.

    (e) A vessel other than a crossing vessel or a vessel joining or leaving a lane shall not normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except:

        (i) in cases of emergency to avoid immediate danger;
        (ii) to engage in fishing within a separation zone.

    (f) A vessel navigating in areas near the terminations of traffic separation schemes shall do so with particular caution.

    (g) A vessel shall so far as practicable avoid anchoring in a traffic separation scheme or in areas near its terminations.

    (h) A vessel not using a traffic separation scheme shall avoid it by as wide a margin as is practicable.

    (i) A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane.

    (j) A vessel of less than 20 metres in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the safe passage of a power-driven vessel following a traffic lane.

    (k) A vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre when engaged in an operation for the maintenance of safety of navigation in a traffic separation scheme is exempted from complying with this Rule to the extent necessary to carry out the operation.

    (l) A vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre when engaged in an operation for the laying, servicing or picking up of a submarine cable, within a traffic separation scheme, is exempted from complying with this Rule to the extent necessary to carry out the operation.

### Section II - Conduct of Vessels in Sight of One Another

#### Rule 11 - Application

Rules in this section apply to vessels in sight of one another.

#### Rule 12 Sailing vessels

    (a) When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other as follows:

        (i) when each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other;
        (ii) when both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward;
        (iii) if a vessel with the wind on the port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or on the starboard side, she shall keep out of the way of the other.

    (b) For the purpose of this Rule the windward side shall be deemed to be the side opposite to that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a square-rigged vessel, the side opposite to that on which the largest fore-and-aft sail is carried.

#### Rule 13 - Overtaking

    (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rules of part B, sections I and II, any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.

    (b) A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam, that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights.

    (c) When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.

    (d) Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.

#### Rule 14 - Head-on situation

    (a) When two power-driven vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.

    (b) Such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she could see the masthead lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line and/or both sidelights and by day she observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel.

    (c) When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists she shall assume that it does exist and act accordingly.

#### Rule 15 - Crossing situation

When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.

#### Rule 16 - Action by give-way vessel

Every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, take early and substantial action to keep well clear.

#### Rule 17 - Action by stand-on vessel

    (a)
    
        (i) Where one of two vessels is to keep out of the way the other shall keep her course and speed.
        (ii) The latter vessel may however take action to avoid collision by her manoeuvre alone, as soon as it becomes apparent to her that the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with these Rules.

    (b) When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and speed finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision.

    (c) A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with subparagraph (a)(ii) of this Rule to avoid collision with another power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side.

    (d) This Rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep out of the way.

#### Rule 18 - Responsibilities between vessels

Except where Rules 9, 10 and 13 otherwise require:

    (a) A power-driven vessel underway shall keep out of the way of:

        (i) a vessel not under command;
        (ii) a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre;
        (iii) a vessel engaged in fishing;
        (iv) a sailing vessel.

    (b) A sailing vessel underway shall keep out of the way of:

        (i) a vessel not under command;
        (ii) a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre;
        (iii) a vessel engaged in fishing.

    (c) A vessel engaged in fishing when underway shall, so far as possible, keep out of the way of:

        (i) a vessel not under command;
        (ii) a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre.

    (d)

        (i) Any vessel other than a vessel not under command or a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid impeding the safe passage of a vessel constrained by her draught, exhibiting the signals in Rule 28.
        (ii) A vessel constrained by her draught shall navigate with particular caution having full regard to her special condition.

    (e) A seaplane on the water shall, in general, keep well clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation. In circumstances, however, where risk of collision exists, she shall comply with the Rules of this part.

    (f)

        (i) A WIG craft shall, when taking off, landing and in flight near the surface, keep well clear of all other vessels and avoid impeding their navigation;
        (ii) a WIG craft operating on the water surface shall comply with the Rules of this Part as a power-driven vessel.

### Section III - Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility

#### Rule 19 - Conduct of vessels in restricted visibility

    (a) This Rule applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility.

    (b) Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility. A power-driven vessel shall have her engines ready for immediate manoeuvre.

    (c) Every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility when complying with the Rules of section I of this part.

    (d) A vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel shall determine if a close-quarters situation is developing and/or risk of collision exists. If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible the following shall be avoided:

        (i) an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken;
        (ii) an alteration of course towards a vessel abeam or abaft the beam.

  (e) Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a close-quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam, shall reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on her course. She shall if necessary take all her way off and in any event navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.
  
## Part C - Lights and Shapes

#### Rule 20 - Application

    (a) Rules in this part shall be complied with in all weathers.

        Note: The maximum luminous intensity of navigation lights should be limited to avoid undue glare. This shall not be achieved by a variable control of the luminous intensity.

#### 9. Horizontal sectors

    (a)

        (i) In the forward direction, sidelights as fitted on the vessel shall show the minimum required intensities. The intensities shall decrease to reach practical cut-off between 1 degree and 3 degrees outside the prescribed sectors.
        (ii) For sternlights and masthead lights and at 22.5° abaft the beam for sidelights, the minimum required intensities shall be maintained over the arc of the horizon up to 5 degrees within the limits of the sectors prescribed in Rule 21. From 5 degrees within the prescribed sectors the intensity may decrease by 50 per cent up to the prescribed limits; it shall decrease steadily to reach practical cut-off at not more than 5 degrees outside the prescribed sectors.

    (b)
    
        (i) All-round lights shall be so located as not to be obscured by masts, topmasts or structures within angular sectors of more than 6 degrees, except anchor lights prescribed in Rule 30, which need not be placed at an impracticable height above the hull.
        (ii) If it is impracticable to comply with paragraph (b)(i) of this section by exhibiting only one all-round light, two all-round lights shall be used suitably positioned or screened so that they appear, as far as practicable, as one light at a distance of one mile.

#### 10. Vertical sectors

    (a) The vertical sectors of electric lights as fitted, with the exception of lights on sailing vessels underway shall ensure that:

        (i) at least the required minimum intensity is maintained at all angles from 5 degrees above to 5 degrees below the horizontal;
        (ii) at least 60 per cent of the required minimum intensity is maintained from 7.5 degrees above to 7.5 degrees below the horizontal.

    (b) In the case of sailing vessels underway the vertical sectors of electric lights as fitted shall ensure that:

        (i) at least the required minimum intensity is maintained at all angles from 5 degrees above to 5 degrees below the horizontal;
        (ii) at least 50 per cent of the required minimum intensity is maintained from 25 degrees above to 25 degrees below the horizontal.

    (c) In the case of lights other than electric these specifications shall be met as closely as possible.

#### 11. Intensity of non-electric lights

 Non-electric lights shall so far as practicable comply with the minimum intensities, as specified in the table given in section 8 of this Annex.

#### 12. Manoeuvring light

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2(f) of this Annex the manoeuvring light described in Rule 34(b) shall be placed in the same fore and aft vertical plane as the masthead light or lights and, where practicable, at a minimum height of 2 metres vertically above the forward masthead light, provided that it shall be carried not less than 2 metres vertically above or below the after masthead light. On a vessel where only one masthead light is carried the manoeuvring light, if fitted, shall be carried where it can best be seen, not less than 2 metres vertically apart from the masthead light.

#### 13. High-speed craft [footnote]

    (a) The masthead light of high-speed craft may be placed at a height related to the breadth of the craft lower than that prescribed in paragraph 2(a)(i) of this annex, provided that the base angle of the isosceles triangles formed by the sidelights and masthead light, when seen in end elevation, is not less than 27º.

    (b) On high-speed craft of 50 metres or more in length, the vertical separation between foremast and mainmast light of 4.5 metres required by paragraph 2(a)(ii) of this annex may be modified provided that such distance shall not be less than the value determined by the following formula:

            y = (a+17Ψ) C +2
                –––––––––
                  1000

        where:
        y = is the height of the mainmast light above the fore mast light in metres;
        a = is the height of the foremast light above the water surface in service condition in metres;
        ψ = is the trim in service condition in degrees;
        C = is the horizontal separation of masthead lights in metres.

#### 14. Approval

The construction of lights and shapes and the installation of lights on board the vessel shall be to the satisfaction of the appropriate authority of the State whose flag the vessel is entitled to fly.

## Annex II - Additional Signals for Fishing Vessels Fishing in Close Proximity

#### 1. General

The lights mentioned herein shall, if exhibited in pursuance of Rule 26(d), be placed where they can best be seen. They shall be at least 0.9 metre apart but at a lower level than lights prescribed in Rule 26(b)(i) and (c)(i). The lights shall be visible all round the horizon at a distance of at least 1 mile but at a lesser distance than the lights prescribed by these Rules for fishing vessels.

#### 2. Signals for trawlers

    (a) Vessels of 20 metres or more in length when engaged in trawling, whether using demersal or pelagic gear, shall exhibit:

        (i) when shooting their nets:
            - two white lights in a vertical line;

        (ii) when hauling their nets:
            - one white light over one red light in a vertical line;

        (iii) when the net has come fast upon an obstruction:
            - two red lights in a vertical line.

    (b) Each vessel of 20 metres or more in length engaged in pair trawling shall exhibit:

        (i) by night, a searchlight directed forward and in the direction of the other vessel of the pair;
        (ii) when shooting or hauling their nets or when the nets have come fast upon an obstruction, the lights prescribed in 2(a) above.

    (c) A vessel of less than 20 metres in length engaged in trawling, whether using demersal or pelagic gear or engaged in pair trawling, may exhibit the lights prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate.

#### 3. Signals for purse seiners

Vessels engaged in fishing with purse seine gear may exhibit two yellow lights in a vertical line. These lights shall flash alternately every second and with equal light and occultation duration. These lights may be exhibited only when the vessel is hampered by its fishing gear.

## Annex III - Technical Details of Sound Signal Appliances

#### 1. Whistles

    (a) Frequencies and range of audibility

        The fundamental frequency of the signal shall lie within the range 70-700Hz. The range of audibility of the signal from a whistle shall be determined by those frequencies, which may include the fundamental and/or one or more higher frequencies, which lie within the range 180-700Hz (+/-1%) for a vessel of 20 metres or more in length, or 180-2100Hz (+/-1%) for a vessel of less than 20 metres in length and which provide the sound pressure levels specified in paragraph 1(c) below.

    (b) Limits of fundamental frequencies

    To ensure a wide variety of whistle characteristics, the fundamental frequency of a whistle shall be between the following limits:

        (i) 70-200 Hz, for a vessel 200 metres or more in length;
        (ii) 130-350 Hz, for a vessel 75 metres but less than 200 metres in length;
        (iii) 250-700 Hz, for a vessel less than 75 metres in length.

    (c) Sound signal intensity and range of audibility

        A whistle fitted in a vessel shall provide, in the direction of maximum intensity of the whistle and at a distance of 1 metre from it, a sound pressure level in at least one 1/3rd-octave band within the range of frequencies 180-700Hz (+/-1%) for a vessel of 20 metres or more in length, or 180-2100Hz (+/-1%) for a vessel of less than 20 metres in length, of not less than the appropriate figure given in the table below.

    |----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
    | Length of vessel in metres | 1/3rd-octave band level        | Audibility range  |
    |                            | in dB referred to 2x10^-5N/m2  | in nautical miles |
    |----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
    | 200 or more                | 143                            | 2                 |
    | 75 but less than 200       | 138                            | 1.5               |
    | 20 but less than 75        | 130                            | 1                 |
    | Less than 2                | 120 *1*                        | 0.5               |
    |                            | 115 *2*                        |                   |
    |                            | 111 *3*                        |                   |
    |----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|

    *1 When the measured frequencies lie within the range 180-450Hz
    *2 When the measured frequencies lie within the range 450-800Hz
    *3 When the measure frequencies lie within the range 800-2100Hz



    The range of audibility in the table above is for information and is approximately the range at which a whistle may be heard on its forward axis with 90 per cent probability in conditions of still air on board a vessel having average background noise level at the listening posts (taken to be 68 dB in the octave band centred on 250 Hz and 63 dB in the octave band centred on 500Hz. 

    In practice the range at which a whistle may be heard is extremely variable and depends critically on weather conditions; the values given can be regarded as typical but under conditions of strong wind or high ambient noise level at the listening post the range may be much reduced.

    (d) Directional properties

        The sound pressure level of a directional whistle shall be not more than 4 dB below the prescribed sound pressure level on the axis at any direction in the horizontal plane within ± 45 degrees of the axis. The sound pressure level at any other direction in the horizontal plane shall be not more than 10 dB below the prescribed sound pressure level on the axis, so that the range in any direction will be at least half the range on the forward axis. The sound pressure level shall be measured in that 1/3rd-octave band which determines the audibility range.

    (e) Positioning of whistles

        When a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistle on a vessel, it shall be installed with its maximum intensity directed straight ahead.

        A whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel, in order to reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and also to minimize hearing damage risk to personnel. The sound pressure level of the vessel's own signal at listening posts shall not exceed 110 dB (A) and so far as practicable should not exceed 100 dB (A).

    (f) Fitting of more than one whistle

        If whistles are fitted at a distance apart of more than 100 metres, it shall be so arranged that they are not sounded simultaneously.

    (g) Combined whistle systems

        If due to the presence of obstructions the sound field of a single whistle or one of the whistles referred to in paragraph 1(f) above is likely to have a zone of greatly reduced signal level, it is recommended that a combined whistle system be fitted so as to overcome this reduction. For the purposes of the Rules a combined whistle system is to be regarded as a single whistle. The whistles of a combined system shall be located at a distance apart of not more than 100 metres and arranged to be sounded simultaneously. The frequency of any one whistle shall differ from those of the others by at least 10 Hz.

#### 2. Bell or gong

    (a) Intensity of signal

        A bell or gong, or other device having similar sound characteristics shall produce a sound pressure level of not less than 110 dB at a distance of 1 metre from it.

    (b) Construction

        Bells and gongs shall be made of corrosion-resistant material and designed to give a clear tone. The diameter of the mouth of the bell shall be not less than 300 mm for vessels of 20 metres or more in length. Where practicable, a power-driven bell striker is recommended to ensure constant force but manual operation shall be possible. The mass of the striker shall be not less than 3 per cent of the mass of the bell.

#### 3. Approval

    The construction of sound signal appliances, their performance and their installation on board the vessel shall be to the satisfaction of the appropriate authority of the State whose flag the vessel is entitled to fly.
